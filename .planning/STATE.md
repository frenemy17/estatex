# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-09-09)

**Core value:** The agent proposes, the state machine enforces: fast, automated AI qualification and booking coupled with robust, inspectable, deterministic guardrails.
**Current focus:** Phase 02 — Autonomous Queue Resilience

## Current Position

Phase: 3 — Monolithic Server Refactoring
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-09-10 — Phase 2 complete, transitioned to Phase 3

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50%

## Performance Metrics

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in `PROJECT.md` Key Decisions table:

- **ADR-0001**: The agent proposes, state machine enforces.
- **ADR-0002**: Queue-less architecture (FastAPI BackgroundTasks + MongoDB `scheduled_actions`).
- **ADR-0003**: Single qualification code path for mock & live paths (`qualify_and_route`).
- **ADR-0004**: Fail-closed admin security model with `ADMIN_TOKEN`.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers and Fragilities

- Groq model decommission risk: keep active models configured.
- Twilio trial account restriction: only verified phone numbers can receive SMS.
- Cal.com API credentials: valid API key and event type ID needed for real booking commits.
- Resend email sending domain: requires verified domain or fallback to `onboarding@resend.dev`.
